Alternative Assessment
Students who have worked independently on a project throughout the semester can submit their project for assessment. Working independently means that you created the software you are working on yourself, and are the sole responsible person. On smaller projects, this may mean that you are the only person working as an engineer on your team. On larger projects, this may mean that you are responsible for a single application layer, for instance. If you are unsure about this, just ask.

Submission of a project must include:

a link to the codebase of the project including the entire version control history
instructions to install and run the software
sufficient self written code to assess basic programming competencies
Additionally you should hand in:

sufficient technical documentation
a brief explanation of tools used, with reasoning explained. This should at a minimum include the topics mentioned in the module description.
Before submitting an alternative assessment request please book a consulting session with the assesor, esp. to make sure that you can fullfill the 3rd hand-in requirement with your project
